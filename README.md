## Armadino - an Arduino Gameboy, Clock, Electronic Lab, TVout Console and more...

![](img/armadino.jpg)

**Armadino** is meant to be much more than a Arduino-based handheld gamepad. By attaching appropriate accessories to the expansion pins, it may be turned into a LED clock, a TV game console, an Arduino experiment kit or just about any creative project to control or sense.

It is not over-the-top and despite its brutal simplicity, has a colour LED matrix, a score board and 6-button keypad that make it both fun and versatile. Don't just experiment and learn, make something useful with it and proudly display it.

**Armadino** is also suitable for STEM education - from junior introduction to digital making to a college or graduate course in programming, embedded systems and micro-controller.

The **Armadino** is programmable as an Arduino UNO, with library functions for LED matrix, 7-segment LED, buttons, sound and TVout, and example projects including a clock, handheld game (Snake, Pong, Space Invaders) and TVout games (Tetris, Breakout, Space Invaders again!)
